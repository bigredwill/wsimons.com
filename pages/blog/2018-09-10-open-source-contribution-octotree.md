A coworker introduced me to the chrome plugin, [Octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree). It provides a tree view for any repository you're viewing on Github to quickly navigate between files. A few people had submitted issues requesting a filtered tree view for pull requests that only shows files that are changed. I wanted that feature as well since our company had moved to Github for source control and pull requests.

It was fun diving in to Github's API and learning about a different Javascript architecture than I was used to. 

See the full pull request on Github at [pull #428](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree/pull/428).
